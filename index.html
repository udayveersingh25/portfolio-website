                <h2>My Name is Udayveer Singh,</h2>
                <p>
                    a student, writer, and emerging technologist who lives at the intersection of creativity and logic.
                    I’m currently studying at Scaler School of Technology, building my foundation in computer science
                    while staying rooted in storytelling, design, and culture.

                    I thrive in spaces where art meets systems — whether that’s coding interactive projects, crafting
                    thoughtful copy, or managing operations at Karuna Cares, a student-led NGO promoting mental health
                    and body positivity. My work there has honed my organizational instincts and my belief that tech
                    should serve people, not just impress them.

                    Outside academics, I’m a music enthusiast (hip-hop runs deep), an anime watcher, and a fiction
                    writer exploring worlds that blend realism with introspection. My creative pursuits fuel how I
                    approach tech — with empathy, imagination, and curiosity.

                    Ultimately, I’m working toward becoming the kind of creator who builds tools and stories that
                    actually matter — things that make people feel something, think deeper, or see the world a bit
                    differently.

                I’ve been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for about two months, and I’m already hooked on the process
                of turning ideas into interactive designs. I’ve built a few small projects to strengthen my fundamentals
                and explore how structure, style, and logic come together on the web. Every line of code teaches me
                something new — whether it’s about layout precision, responsive design, or clean functionality. I’m
                still early in my web dev journey, but I’m learning fast and loving the challenge.

                    <p>
                        I’ve always been drawn to the mysteries of the universe. Back in high school, astrophysics
                        fascinated me — the math, the cosmic scale, the idea of understanding existence through
                        equations. That passion led me to prepare for JEE, aiming for a good college where I could dive
                        deeper into space science.

                        But life had other plans. During my JEE prep at Allen, Chandigarh, living away from home,
                        something new caught my attention — artificial intelligence. It started in early 2023 when
                        ChatGPT-3.5 dropped and suddenly, the world was talking about AI. I began experimenting with
                        everything I could find — image generators, voice models, music AIs — fascinated by how
                        creativity and computation could merge.

                        Over time, my curiosity shifted from stars to systems, from telescopes to algorithms. I realized
                        that what drew me to astrophysics — discovery, pattern-seeking, understanding complex systems —
                        was also at the heart of AI. That realization steered me toward computer science, and
                        eventually, to the Scaler School of Technology, where I’m now building the foundation to create
                        and understand the next generation of intelligent systems.
